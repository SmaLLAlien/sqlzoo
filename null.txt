Solve
SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile,  '07986 444 2266') AS mobile FROM teacher

6

Solve
SELECT x.name name, COALESCE(y.name, 'None') name FROM teacher x
LEFT JOIN dept y ON y.id = x.dept

7
Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

Solve
SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile)
FROM teacher

Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

Solve
SELECT y.name, COUNT(x.name) FROM teacher x
RIGHT JOIN dept y ON x.dept = y.id
GROUP BY y.name

9
Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

FROM teacher

SELECT name, CASE WHEN dept  <= 2 THEN 'Sci'
                  WHEN dept  = 3 THEN 'Art'
